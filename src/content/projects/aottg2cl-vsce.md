![AoTTG 2 Custom Logic VSCode](/images/projects/acl.webp)

I developed a full extension for Visual Studio Code to support the Custom Logic language. It offers syntax highlighting, auto-complete, and error checking (diagnostics) to help other developers.

This was my first experience creating an extension, so I jumped into the deep end.

Fun fact: I didn't create game modes because I wanted to play. I wrote them to learn the language specifically for this tool. I needed to understand every detail to make the extension work perfectly.
