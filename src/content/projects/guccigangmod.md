I've been playing AoTTG since 2013 and still do. By now that's almost half of my life. GucciGangMod is a mod for the original AoTTG, and that's where I started learning to program.

Some in the CIS community thought it was one of the best modifications back then: quality, features and no abusive or cheat stuff, which was rare back then. As far as I know, it was also the first open-source mod in the community, while before that all mods were private or obfuscated.

In the community there were rumors that some modders and people who use mods were not honest in competitive (duels, tournaments). I decided to quit competitive for good before I got into modding.

I didn't want to be in that place where any win could be questioned, not just by others but by myself too, and I didn't want to always have to prove I play fair. It felt simpler and more honest to leave competitive behind and just create things for others.
