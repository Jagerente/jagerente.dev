![Attack on Titan Tribute Game 2](/images/projects/aottg2.webp)

I've been part of the AoTTG community since 2013. It is a huge part of my life. Now I contribute to Attack on Titan Tribute Game 2.

I didn't plan to join the dev team officially. At first I just wanted to explore Custom Logic and check for security bugs. I created several game modes and built an editor tool (like IntelliSense) to help other authors work faster. That was before I joined the team. But eventually things turned out that way.

For me, AoTTG is about community and communication first. The game comes second. I contribute as Game Developer and Custom Logic Developer.
