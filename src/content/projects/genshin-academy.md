Co-founded Genshin Academy with friends we met through AoTTG. Started as guides and tutorials for Genshin Impact. It became one of the best informative and educational resources with unique original content in the CIS segment and beyond. We later expanded to Honkai: Star Rail, Zenless Zone Zero, Chaos Zero Nightmare, Arknights: Endfield and more.

Notably, [KeqingMains](https://www.youtube.com/keqingmains), one of the most recognized theorycrafting English-speaking communities, reached out and asked us to [adapt one of our most fundamental guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEhRMijHVz0) for their audience.

**Team:**

- **Bobrokrot** — main founder and brain of the project
- **ShyLevi** (Lineyka, Lime) — lead assistant, advisor, idea generator, designer, manager, and just the best of humankind. Rest in peace.
- **Dixtasy** — lead designer
- **[Derenn](https://t.me/DerennALL)** — channel voice actor, the voice that brings our content to life

I was video editor until I ran out of free time and could no longer dedicate time to it, but I remain manager.
