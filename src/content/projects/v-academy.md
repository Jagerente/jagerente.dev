Together with the Genshin Academy team, we built a comprehensive database for V Rising. It featured a full items catalogue with structures and blueprints, structure variants, advanced search by name and tags, items categories and sets, recipe times and costs and options for Confined Room and Matching Floor discounts.

I was Lead Developer: built the backend in Go and the frontend in Vue 3, handled DevOps - server setup, environment configuration, automated delivery and deployment with GitHub Actions and Ansible. It was a great challenge to build a complex web application from scratch while learning new tools on the fly.

We launched the project as a test run and kept it completely free and ad-free. After a year, we archived it because running it was unsustainable. The game turned out to be a temporary hype rather than a long-term hit.
