I wanted to test the limits of Custom Logic. So, I decided to recreate Portal 2 inside an Attack on Titan game.

It started as a small experiment just to test the mechanics. But I got carried away. It grew into a full remake: the story, dialogue, voice acting, and levels are almost 1:1 with the original. I even added some community maps from the Steam Workshop.

It took me about a month. This is the project I am most proud of.
